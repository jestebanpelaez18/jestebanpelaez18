I transitioned from studying Mechanical Engineering to entering the world of coding when I moved from Malaga, Spain to Helsinki to pursue Software Engineering at Hive Helsinki ! I've always found stats fascinating, and I enjoy keeping up with NBA and football games in my free time. This interest naturally led me to focus on Python and Data Science. Additionally, I've developed a curiosity for Hacking and Cybersecurity – there's something intriguing about dip into that world.

<h3 align="left">Notable Projects</h3>

These are some of the notable projects I've worked on:

- [Minishell](https://github.com/jestebanpelaez18/42Course-Minishell.git): This project aims to develop a user-friendly shell, essentially a simplified version inspired by the bash shell. Implemented in C and using Unix system calls, it optimizes processes and file descriptors. In this shell you will be able to use redirections, piping, executable execution, and seamless handling of quotes, environment variables, and shell expansions. Furthermore, it offers versatility by supporting various types of signals, enhancing your command-line experience. 

- [Cub3D](https://github.com/jestebanpelaez18/Cub3d.git): This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. mplemented in C and employing fundamental algorithms, our endeavor delves into the realm of ray-casting. The objective is to create an immersive view within a maze, challenging you to navigate and discover your path forward
